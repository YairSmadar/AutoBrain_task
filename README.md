# AutoBrain_task

To complete the task, I turned the array into a graph, 
and used the BFS algorithm to see if it was possible to get from the first to the last code.

Please use the attached Makefile to compile the project.
The executable file is called final_program and will be located in a folder called build.

You also can find a valgtind tool output (verify that there is no memory leaks).

Note: I used gcc version 6.3.0
